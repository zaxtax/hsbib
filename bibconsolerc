#-You an add your own file assocations in the format: ".extension = viewer" .
#-All extensions should be in lowercase.
#-As supported by the ConfigFile format, you can substitute other options' values in later options.
#-By convention all entries that start with a ' are to be iqnored, except for purpose of substitution.
#-Substitution is accomplished in the following manner:
#--#declare an option and the value it is to be substituted for:
#--'webbrowser = lynx
#--'textreader = vim
#--#then use it in later options in the following manner:
#--.html = %('webbrowser)s 
#--you can also tack on other characters as well:
#--.txt = %('textreader)s -R
